# Online Ticket Booking System

## Description

I developed a simple RESTful API for an Online Ticket Booking System using Laravel, enabling operations like event listing, user registration, and booking management. <br>
<br>
This API leverages Laravel's robust features to handle CRUD operations efficiently, ensuring a streamlined and scalable solution for managing bookings and events.

## Introduction

Embarking on this assessment has been a valuable learning experience, especially given my initial lack of Laravel experience. Despite the challenges, this journey allowed me to explore Laravelâ€™s core features, including its routing system, Eloquent ORM, and authentication tools. <br>
<br>
The process involved thorough examination of documentation and practical experimentation, which significantly enhanced my understanding and confidence in using Laravel. This hands-on approach not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my proficiency with modern PHP frameworks, preparing me for future projects and demonstrating the practical benefits of immersing oneself in new technologies.
